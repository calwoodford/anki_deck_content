###### Question 1.
What is a stack in data structures? (1)

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. A stack supports two main operations:
Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes the element from the top of the stack.
A stack can be implemented using an array or a linked list. It is often used in algorithms that require backtracking, such as depth-first search in graphs.

###### Question 2.
What is a queue in data structures? (1)

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. A queue supports two main operations:
Enqueue: Adds an element to the end of the queue.
Dequeue: Removes the element from the front of the queue.
A queue can be implemented using an array or a linked list. It is often used in algorithms that require a first-come, first-served approach, such as breadth-first search in graphs.

###### Question 3.
How does a stack differ from a queue? (1)

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
The main difference between a stack and a queue lies in their ordering principles:
A stack follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.
A queue follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, meaning the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.
Additionally, the operations for adding and removing elements are named differently:

In a stack, the operations are called push (for adding) and pop (for removing).
In a queue, the operations are called enqueue (for adding) and dequeue (for removing).
