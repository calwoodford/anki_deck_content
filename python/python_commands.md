###### Question 1.

What is array slicing in python? (1)

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

Array slicing in Python is a technique used to extract a section of elements from an array or list by specifying a start and end index, and an optional step size. 
```python
original_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# Slicing to get a subset of the original list
subset = original_list[2:6]  # This extracts elements from index 2 to 5 (inclusive)

print(subset)  # Output: [3, 4, 5, 6]

```
</p>

###### Question 2.

What is the `.split()` method in Python used for? (1)

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

The `.split()` method in Python is used to split a string into substrings based on a delimiter
```python
text = "Hello, World! This is a sample sentence."

# Splitting the text into words using the default space delimiter
words = text.split()

print(words)
# Output: ['Hello,', 'World!', 'This', 'is', 'a', 'sample', 'sentence.']

```

###### Question 3.

How can you reverse a list? (2)
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
Using the `reverse()` method:
              
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list.reverse()
print(my_list)
# Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

Using slicing to make a reversed copy:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
reversed_list = my_list[::-1]
print(reversed_list)
# Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```
</p>

###### Question 4.

What is a lambda function? How are these written in Python? (1)
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

A lambda function in Python is a small anonymous function defined using the `lambda` keyword. It can have any number of parameters but can have only one statement

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```
</p>

###### Question 5.

How can you remove duplicates from a list in Python? (2)
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
Use a set to remove duplicates, but this will not preserve the order.
  
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
unique_list = list(set(my_list))
print(unique_list)
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
  
Use a loop to maintain order while removing duplicates.
  
```python
Copy code
my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
unique_list = []
for item in my_list:
    if item not in unique_list:
        unique_list.append(item)
print(unique_list)
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
</p>
</details>

###### Question 6.
What is the difference between a tuple and a list in Python? (2)

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
Lists are mutable, created using square brackets [], and generally require more memory.
  
```python
Copy code
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list[0] = 4  # Valid
Tuples are immutable, created using parentheses (), and are more memory-efficient.
python
Copy code
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# my_tuple[0] = 4  # This would raise an error
```

</p>
</details>
<br><br>

###### Question 7.
How do you create a dictionary in Python? (1)

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
A dictionary in Python is created using curly braces {} with pairs of keys and values separated by colons :.

```python
Copy code
# Creating a dictionary with three key-value pairs
my_dict = {
    'name': 'Alice',
    'age': 25,
    'city': 'New York'
}

print(my_dict)
# Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}
```

</p>
</details>
<br><br>

###### Question 8.
What is a list comprehension in Python? (1)

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
List comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python. It consists of an expression followed by the for keyword and an optional if statement.

```python
Copy code
# Using list comprehension to create a list of squares
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

print(squares)
# Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

###### Question 9.

What are modules and packages in Python? (1)
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
Python packages and Python modules are two mechanisms that allow for modular programming in Python.

**Modules** are Python files with a `.py` extension and can have a set of functions, classes and variables and can be imported using the `import` command
```python
import foo
import numpy as np
```

**Packages** are basically modules combined into a folder and help by providing a hierarchical structuring of module namespaces. You can import modules from a package using the `from` command.
```python
from my_package import module1
from scipy import integrate
```

###### Question 10.

What is the `pandas` library used for in Python? (1)
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
Pandas is an open-source, python library used in data manipulation of applications that require high performance. Pandas help perform five significant data analysis steps: load the data, clean/manipulate it, prepare it, model it and analyse it.
</p>

###### Question 11.

How is a `pandas` dataframe created? (1)
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
A data frame is a 2D mutable and tabular structure representing data labelled with axes: rows and columns.
Below is the syntax to create a data frame:

```python
import pandas as pd
dataframe = pd.DataFrame(data, index, columns, dtype)
```

Here `data` represents various forms of data such as series,ndarrys,lists etc.
`index` represents an index to row labels (Optional)
`columns` is an argument for column labels (Optional)
`dtype` is an argument for the data type of each column (Optional)

</p>
</details>
<br><br>

###### Question 12.

How can different `pandas` dataframes be combined? (1)

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

To stack the dataframes horizontally we use the `append()` method

```python
df1.append(df2)
```

To stack the dataframes vertically we use the `concat()` method

```python
pd.concat([df1,df2])
```

The `join` method is used to extract data from various data frames having one or more common columns.

```python
df1.join(df2)
```
</p>

###### Question 13.

How can you add a new column to a pandas dataframe? (1)
<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>
A new column can be added to a pandas dataframe as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd      
data_info = {'first' : pd.Series([1, 2, 3], index = ['a', 'b', 'c']),    
       'second' : pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4], index = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])}    
  
df = pd.DataFrame(data_info)    
# To add new column third
df['third']=pd.Series([10,20,30], index= ['a','b','c'])    
    
# To add new column fourth
df['fourth'] = df['first'] + info['third']
```
</p>
